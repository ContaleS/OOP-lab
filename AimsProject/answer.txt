Question 1: When should accessor methods be used?
       It should be used whenever we need to access or modify the private state of an object in a controlled manner.
One of the main benefits of using accessor methods is that they provide an encapsulation mechanism for the
object's internal state, preventing direct access to the object's fields from outside the object itself. This
encapsulation protects the object's internal state, making it easier to maintain over time by preventing unintended changes.

       Accessor methods are also helpful for validating and normalizing input before it gets assigned to the object's
fields. For example, a setter method for a person's age field could ensure that the age value is within a valid range,
such as between 0 and 120 years old.

       Overall, using accessor methods helps ensure that an object's internal state is accessed and modified in a
   controlled and maintainable way.

Question 2: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a
DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
       It does not allow us to do this. Java will display an error:" 'hust.soict.ict.aims.disc.DigitalVideoDc(String)' is already defined in
'hust.soict.ict.aims.disc.DigitalVideoDc'". It means that the method is duplicate

    Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number ofarguments for dvd. Compare to an
array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?
    I like this method than an array parameter, since it is easy to add items. When I use array parameter, it will add
all elements of the array including of null elements, then it makes error.

    Question: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
Java is a Pass by Value programming language

    After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
Since when we call swap function, the two parameter in this function copy the value of the two object you want to
change the value. So it does not return the result as we expect.

    After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
Since it directly changes the value of the object

    Write a toString() method for the DigitalVideoDisc class. What should be the return type of this method?
String should be the return type of this method
